						How does 3D printing work?
						<a href="#faq-how3dprintingworks" class="icon-permalink" style="font-size: 14px;"></a>
					</h4>
					<p>
						3D Printing takes digital files and turns them into physical products. 
						It is often referred to as additive manufacturing, as the product is built up layer by layer in the material of your choosing. 
						3D Printing refers to several different processes that are applied based on the specific material type, including the most popular, selective laser sintering.

				<h2>Placing an Order</h2>
				<div class="faqQuestion sep-top" id="faq-paymentoptions">
					<h4>
						Which payment options can I use?
						<a href="#faq-" class="icon-permalink" style="font-size: 14px;"></a>
					</h4>
					<h5>Credit Card</h5>
					<p>
						
					</p>
					<h5>Paypal</h5>
					<p>
						Orders may be paid for via PayPal as long as <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/country-worldwide">PayPal</a> is available in your country. 
						Check PayPal to see where it is available. You may pay via PayPal in either USD or EUR, depending on the destination country of your order.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please refer to <a href="https://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a> for payment limits, countries that accept PayPal, disputes, and other terms.
					</p>
					<h5>Bank Trnasfer</h5>
					<p>
						Orders can be paid for via wire (i.e., bank-to-bank transfer). 
						When selecting Bank Transfer as the payment method during check-out, you will receive specific wiring instructions depending on the destination country of your order. 
						Be sure to include your customer and invoice number.
					</p>
					<p>
						Customers should plan for an additional 2-5 days of payment processing time on top of the standard Shapeways order timeline, 
						as Shapeways will only begin production after payment has been received in full.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please be aware that you may incur additional bank service, transfer, or other fees when paying with bank transfer.
					</p>
				</div>

					<h4>
						Which currencies are available to me?
						<a href="#faq-currencies" class="icon-permalink" style="font-size: 14px;"></a>
					</h4>
					<p>
						Payments can only be processed in USD or EUR, based on your shipping country. 
						For customers who are reviewing invoices, please note that invoices will also reflect your payment currency.
					</p>
					<p>
						Your bank or credit card issuer may apply additional currency fees to your payment.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can view prices in different currencies (including USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, or CAD) by visiting the site footer. 
						Prices are approximate and are converted from USD using a monthly exchange rate that changes on the 1st of every month.

					<h4>
						What happens after I place an order?
						<a href="#faq-afterorder" class="icon-permalink" style="font-size: 14px;"></a>
					</h4>
					<p>
						After you place an order, our 3D printing experts will manually review every item to make sure we can manufacture it successfully. 
						Once it is deemed to be viable for printing, we manufacture products using the most advanced 3D printing technology available. 
						Then, we inspect the quality of each product, carefully package it, and send it your way.
					</p>
					<p>
						Given the complex nature of converting digital files into physical products, every now and then we catch designs that are too fragile to create.

				<h2>Beta Products and First To Try</h2>
				<div class="faqQuestion sep-top" id="faq-wahtbeta">
					<h4>
						What is a Beta Product?
						<a href="#faq-wahtbeta" class="icon-permalink" style="font-size: 14px;"></a>
					</h4>
					<p>
						Beta Products are early stage products that customers can buy, test and give feedback on. 
						Designers who are interested in feedback on their products can opt-in to make a specific product in Beta, and are able to opt-out at anytime.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Beta program gives you the ability to introduce an early stage product and collect feedback from customers on design, fit, workability and more.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faqQuestion sep-top" id="faq-whatftt">
					<h4>
						What is First To Try?
						<a href="#faq-whatftt" class="icon-permalink" style="font-size: 14px;"></a>
					</h4>
					<p>
						If a product is in First To Try it means it has not gone through our printers before, 
						and is a way for shoppers to distinguish items that have been printed and tested from those that have not.
					</p>
					<p>
						If a product has been printed in some materials, the First To Try label will only show up on materials it has not been printed in. 
						This means one product could have the label under Stainless Steel but not White Strong & Flexible.
					</p>
					<p>
						We think it's important to communicate to shoppers that products that have not been printed before carry small risks, 
						and if there are kinks or the product does not print we will refund the customer's money.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faqQuestion sep-top" id="faq-howfttpics">
					<h4>
						How can a model be First To Try if it has pictures?
						<a href="#faq-howfttpics" class="icon-permalink" style="font-size: 14px;"></a>
					</h4>
					<p>
						A model with pictures can still be in First To Try if the 3D model used to create the product was changed after being printed. 
						While these updates are usually in response to customer feedback and make the product more functional, 
						they can't be moved out of First To Try until they have gone through our printers.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are also instances where a product has been printed in one material and then painted or altered or was printed on an at-home 3D printer. 
						If it hasn't gone through our printers it will be in First To Try.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faqQuestion sep-top" id="faq-fttrisks">
					<h4>
						What is the risk/guarantee of buying a First To Try Item?
						<a href="#faq-fttrisks" class="icon-permalink" style="font-size: 14px;"></a>
					</h4>
					<p>
						First To Try means the product has not gone through our printers prior to purchase, so there is a risk the finished product might look different 
						from the render and the product might not turn out as expected. 
						If shoppers are unsure about any aspect of the product, they can contact the designer for questions.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our standard return policy applies to all products. For First To Try items, if we are not able to print the product successfully we will refund your money 
						but we cannot guarantee that the designer will fix the model so that it will be printable for future iterations.

				<h2>Processing Your Order and Payment</h2>
				<div class="faqQuestion sep-top" id="faq-charged">
					<h4>
						When will I be charged?
						<a href="#faq-charged" class="icon-permalink" style="font-size: 14px;"></a>
					</h4>
					<h5>Credit Card or Paypal</h5>
					<p>
						When you place an order we will put an authorization hold on your credit card or PayPal account. 
						We only charge your payment after we have reviewed and accepted your order for production or after 7 calendar days for credit card orders 
						and 3 days for PayPal orders (the longest we can hold the authorization), whichever is sooner. 
						While we expect most items to be reviewed within 7 days, some items may take longer to review.
					</p>
					<p>
						If your order contains a gift card, we will issue your electronic gift card immediately and charge the full order amount as soon as the order is placed.
					</p>
					<p>
						If at any point we determine that we cannot manufacture an item in your order, you will not have to pay for it. 
						If we have not yet processed your payment, you will not be charged for the item. If we have already processed your payment, we will issue you a 
						<a href="Refund.html">refund</a>.
					</p>
					<h5>Bank Transfer</h5>
					<p>
						Bank transfers do not go through the same authorization and charge process as credit cards and PayPal. 
						After we receive the full payment from your bank, we will begin reviewing your order. 
						If we determine that we cannot manufacture an item in your order, we will issue you a <a href="Refund.html">refund</a>.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faqQuestion sep-top" id="faq-authorization">
					<h4>
						What is a payment authorization?
						<a href="#faq-authorization" class="icon-permalink" style="font-size: 14px;"></a>
					</h4>
					<p>
						A payment authorization is a pending charge or hold on a payment account. 
						This is not a complete charge, and will typically appear on your bank statement under "Pending Charges". 
						We use payment authorizations with credit cards and PayPal payments to ensure that we will be able to charge your payment successfully after reviewing your order.
					</p>
					<p>
						If we determine that we cannot manufacture any of the items in your order before your payment has been charged, we will void the authorization. 
						This may appear as a refund or may be deleted from your credit card statement or account. 
						If we cannot manufacture part of your order, we will only charge you for the items we can manufacture.
					</p>
					<p>
						The maximum time we can hold a payment authorization is 7 calendar days. 
						If we have not finished reviewing the items in your order by this time, we will charge your payment method for the items still being reviewed. 
						If we have already charged your payment and determine later that we cannot manufacture an item in your order, 
						we will issue a <a href="Refund.html">refund</a> since the charge can no longer be voided.

					<h4>
						How does Shapeways process refunds?
						<a href="#faq-refunds" class="icon-permalink" style="font-size: 14px;"></a>
					</h4>
					<p>
						Refunds for credit card, PayPal or bank transfer payments are issued in the original form of payment and will reflect the amount paid. 
						It may take 3-7 business days for the refund to appear in your account. 
						Orders paid with store credit, gift cards, or promotional dollars will be returned in that form.
					</p>
					<p>
						We may contact you to obtain additional information if necessary. 
						In certain cases where we determine a refund is not appropriate, we may issue store credit.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faqQuestion sep-top" id="faq-storecredit">
					<h4>
						I used to receive store credit when my items couldn't be made. Can I still get store credit?
						<a href="#faq-storecredit" class="icon-permalink" style="font-size: 14px;"></a>
					</h4>
					<p>
						If we cannot manufacture items in your order, we believe you should not be responsible for the cost of those items. 
						Based on this philosophy, <b>we no longer issue store credit when items cannot be manufactured</b> and instead either void your payment authorization 
						or issue a refund if you have already been charged for the item(s).
					</p>
					<p>
						If you have previously-issued store credit in your account, you can continue to use it or you may choose to have it refunded. 
						If you would like to refund these credits to the original method of payment,

				<h2>Shipping Info</h2>
				<div class="faqQuestion sep-top" id="faq-deliverytime">
					<h4>
						What is the delivery time for Shapeways products?
						<a href="#faq-deliverytime" class="icon-permalink" style="font-size: 14px;"></a>
					</h4>
					<p>
						Delivery time for Shapeways orders varies based on the material ordered and the shipping option selected.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our materials use many different production processes which means that their production times vary. 
						Visit our Materials page to find specific production times for each material. 
						Please take note that we ship all items together, so the product in your order with the longest lead time will determine when your order will ship. 
						You can see the estimated ship date for your order in your shopping cart or on the order status page.
					</p>
					<p>
						We do our best to get your orders to you as quickly as possible. 
						The listed production times for Shapeways materials take into account the challenges of manufacturing unique and untested designs. 
						This means that many items ship ahead of schedule, though we cannot guarantee it. Unfortunately, some designs may also face delays. 
						We'll provide email alerts to keep you updated on the status of your order, and you can always check your order status page.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once we've shipped your order, package transit time will depend on the shipping option and destination. 
						All orders ship with a tracking number that you can use to monitor the status of your order in transit.
