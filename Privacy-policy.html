				<h1>RealObject Privacy Statement</h1>
				<p>
					Last updated Dec 15, 2016.
				</p>
				<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
				<p>
					RealObject, Inc. and its affiliates collects and uses your personal data such as your name, e-mail address and your place of residence in order to provide you with the 
					RealObject services. When you order on the Website, we ask for your name and email address in order to create an account for you. When you send an order to us, we ask for 
					your delivery address to be able to fulfill your orders.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also use your information to communicate with you about our services. You can always indicate and change your choice whether you want to receive such communication by 
					inform us from your email. We also may use your personal data for our internal purposes such as administration of our Website, improving our services, and compliance with 
					our legal obligations.
				</p>
				<h3>How We Protect Your Data</h3>
				<p>
					Your personal data will be collected and treated in strict confidence and kept secure according to best practices such as firewall user access controls, and secure socket 
					layer (SSL) technology. Access to your personal data will be restricted to a limited number of administrators. Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the internet 
					or electronic storage is perfectly secure. While we work hard to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
				</p>
				<h3>Information We Share</h3>
				<p>
					We do not sell, rent or license your personal data to third parties. However, please be informed that we may share your personal data with other businesses (our service 
					providers) for example to enable them to provide their services to us or to you (for instance handling your orders). We require these service providers to protect your 
					personal data adequately. They are not allowed to use your personal data for any purpose not specifically authorized by Shapeways or by you.
				</p>
				<p>
					RealObject maintains office in the United States, and works with service providers located around the world. By agreeing to our privacy policy you agree that your personal 
					information may be transferred from your home country to third parties located around the world.
				</p>
				<h3>Your Financial Information</h3>
				<p>
					We do not currently collect financial information, as that information is collected and stored by our third party payment processor. However, we may from time to time 
					request and receive some of your financial information from our payment processor for the purposes of completing transactions you have initiated through the services, 
					protecting against or identify possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage our business. In those cases we will use best practices to protect your 
					financial information.
				</p>
				<h3>Transfer of Assets</h3>
				<p>
					In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, 
					or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired 
					by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this 
					policy.
				</p>
				<h3>Access and Disclosure</h3>
				<p>
					We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal 
					process or governmental request, (ii) enforce our Terms and Conditions, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) enforce our Content Policy, including 
					investigation of potential violations hereof, (iv) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (v) respond to user support requests, or (vi) 
					protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and 
					spam/malware prevention.
				</p>
				<h3>Disclosure to Governments, Third Parties, and as a Result of Lawful Court Order</h3>
				<p>
					Except in emergency situations or when consistent with the RealObject Terms and Conditions or this Privacy Policy, RealObject requires valid and sufficient legal process to 
					compel disclosure of records or information about RealObject customers. This process may include a subpoena, warrant, or court order. This process must contain enough 
					information to identify the user’s account and minimize the likelihood of accidental disclosure of information from unrelated accounts.
				</p>
				<p>
					When we receive legal process from non-governmental third parties seeking records or information about a RealObject customer we may provide notice to that customer. Such 
					notice may include a copy of the legal process. RealObject may also provide the customer with enough time to appear and object to the legal process in court, if appropriate.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our policy is to provide notice to users about law enforcement and other governmental requests for user information prior to complying with that request, unless prohibited 
					by law. RealObject may delay notice in cases involving the threat of death, bodily harm, or the exploitation of children. It is also our policy to provide notice to users 
					about grand jury subpoenas seeking user information. If you are a representative of law enforcement or a government and object to a user receiving notice of a specific request, 
					please provide legal justification when serving your request. Once the basis for non-disclosure has expired, we will provide notice to the user. All requests for access to 
					user data can be submitted to <a href="mailto:service@realobject.com">service@realobject.com</a>.
